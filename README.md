if fed the command line argument "my tweets", it prints out the most recent 20 tweets from the linked account.
if fed the command line argument "spotify-this-song" plus a song title, it will print out the song's artist, title, preview link, and album. if the user provides no searchable song title, it will output information for The Sign by Ace of Base (idk what this song is).
if fed the command line argument "movie-this" plus a movie title, it will print out the movie's title, year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country, language, plot, and cast. if the user provides no title, it provides the information for Mr. Nobody.
